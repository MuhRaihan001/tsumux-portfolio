                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Greetings, I'm TsumuX, an 18-year-old full-stack developer from Sulawesi Selatan, Indonesia. My primary focus is on backend development, where I specialize in Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MySQL, and NoSQL. While I have strong proficiency in frontend technologies like React.js, my passion lies in the logic and architecture of backend systems.</p>
                <p>Beyond coding, I have a sharp analytical mind that allows me to break down complex problems and solve them efficiently. I thrive in structured problem-solving scenarios, whether in software development or real-world logical puzzles. My adaptability in learning makes me quick to grasp new concepts, and my curiosity drives me to continuously explore new technologies and innovations.</p>

                <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> I have extensive experience with JavaScript for both frontend and backend development. I use JavaScript to build interactive UI components and handle asynchronous operations efficiently.</p>
                <p><strong>TypeScript:</strong> I prefer using TypeScript for backend development due to its static typing, which enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime errors.</p>
                <p><strong>Python:</strong> I use Python primarily for AI development and data processing. I have experience working with TensorFlow for machine learning and OpenCV for image processing.</p>
                <p><strong>Node.js:</strong> My expertise in Node.js allows me to build scalable backend applications, implement RESTful APIs, and optimize performance using event-driven architecture.</p>
                <p><strong>React.js:</strong> While my focus is on backend development, I have a strong grasp of React.js for building dynamic and efficient frontend interfaces.</p>
                <p><strong>MySQL:</strong> I specialize in database optimization, designing efficient schemas, and writing complex queries to handle large datasets while ensuring data integrity.</p>
                <p>My expertise includes API security, authentication (JWT), database optimization, and middleware implementation. I ensure my code follows clean coding practices and maintainability, making applications more efficient and easier to scale.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I am exploring AI development with Python and Node.js using TensorFlow for predictive modeling, image processing, and generative AI. I am also familiar with cloud computing and deployment strategies, ensuring that applications are well-optimized and secure.</p>
                <p>My problem-solving ability enables me to debug complex issues efficiently, and my structured approach to development ensures high-quality, maintainable code. I also have experience integrating third-party APIs and optimizing query performance for high-traffic applications.</p>

                <h2>Music Preferences</h2>
                <p>Music is an essential part of my life. I have a strong appreciation for The Beatles, particularly their early works. Songs from <em>A Hard Day’s Night</em>, <em>With The Beatles</em>, and <em>Help!</em> resonate deeply with me due to their melodic brilliance and tight harmonies.</p>
                <p>While I admire Paul McCartney’s musical genius and multi-instrumental abilities, I feel The Beatles' chemistry was at its peak before 1965. Tracks like "All My Loving," "I Want to Hold Your Hand," and "If I Fell" showcase their artistic synergy at its finest. Their early music had a unique energy and raw creativity that I find unmatched in later works.</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite songs from The Beatles include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Hard Day's Night</li>
                    <li>All My Loving</li>
                    <li>And I Love Her</li>
